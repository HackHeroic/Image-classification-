# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. This model classifies images into 10 categories, including airplanes, cars, birds, and more. The project includes training code, a saved model, and test predictions.

## ðŸ“Œ Features  
- Trained on 50,000 images from CIFAR-10  
- 3 Convolutional layers with MaxPooling  
- Achieved ~72% accuracy  
- Built using TensorFlow and OpenCV  

## ðŸ“‚ Files  
- `main.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with training code  
- `image_classifier.keras` - Trained model file  (after running the code)
- `images/` - Sample test images  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
Clone the repo and open the notebook:  
```bash  
git clone git@github.com:HackHeroic/Image-classification-.git  
jupyter notebook image_classifier.ipynb  
```
